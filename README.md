# Small LED wiring CPX project (with 3d printed xmas tree)

This was just a quick project for my to test my very basic skills of 3d modeling (with TinkerCad), wiring of LED diodes, and programming a Circuit Playground Express. 

 1. Print the stl file
 2. Push LEDs through the holes and wire them up
 3. Connect all the LED cathodes (short leads) to the ground on the CPX
 4. Connect all the LED anodes (long leads) to 220 resistors and then to A1 on the CPX
 5. Press button A on the CPX to light the tree and play a short "Oh Christmas Tree" wav file.
